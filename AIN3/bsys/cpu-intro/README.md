# Questions

1. Run process-run.py with the following flags: `-l 5:100,5:100` (two processes which consist of 5 instructions that use the CPU 100%).
   What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?)

- 100% because of the given flags and no IO process initiated. After PID 0 is done, PID 1 will start immediately.

Output:
```sh
Time     PID: 0     PID: 1        CPU        IOs
  1     RUN:cpu      READY          1
  2     RUN:cpu      READY          1
  3     RUN:cpu      READY          1
  4     RUN:cpu      READY          1
  5     RUN:cpu      READY          1
  6        DONE    RUN:cpu          1
  7        DONE    RUN:cpu          1
  8        DONE    RUN:cpu          1
  9        DONE    RUN:cpu          1
 10        DONE    RUN:cpu          1

Stats: Total Time 10
Stats: CPU Busy 10 (100.00%)
Stats: IO Busy  0 (0.00%)
```

As you can see above, first the process with "process ID" (or "PID") 0 runs,
while process 1 is READY to run but just waits until 0 is done. When 0 is
finished, it moves to the DONE state, while 1 runs. When 1 finishes, the trace
is done.

-----------------------------

2. Now run with these flags: ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0.
   How long does it take to complete both processes?

- 11 clock ticks. PID 0 will run for 4 clock ticks while initiating and finishing an IO process will take 2 clock ticks.
  PID 1 will remain in the BLOCKED state for 5 clock ticks because the python script says so and PID 1 is the one running an IO process.

Output:
```sh
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  2        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  3        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  4        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  5           DONE        RUN:io             1          
  6           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
  7           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
  8           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
  9           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
 10           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
 11*          DONE   RUN:io_done             1

3. Switch the order of the processes: -l 1:0,4:100. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why?

- The order matters because PID 0 is now blocked, waiting for the IO request to finish, while PID 1 will use the CPU.

Output:
```sh
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1          
  2        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  3        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  4        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  5        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  6        BLOCKED          DONE                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done          DONE             1

Stats: IO Busy  5 (71.43%)
```

----------------------------

4. What happens when you run the following two processes (-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH ON END)

- Since the process will only switch upon completion, resources are not used efficiently. PID 0 will be blocked for 5 clock ticks
  while PID 1 is on the ready state, not doing anything.

Output:
```sh
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1          
  2        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  3        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  4        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  5        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  6        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done         READY             1          
  8           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
  9           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
 10           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
 11           DONE       RUN:cpu             1
```

----------------------------

5. Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process 
   whenever one is WAITING for I/O (-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH ON IO). What happens now?

- This results in a more efficient use of resources, clearing up the issue of Question 4. 

Output:
```sh
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1          
  2        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  3        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  4        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  5        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  6        BLOCKED          DONE                           1

```

----------------------------

6. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S 
   SWITCH ON IO -c -p -I IO RUN LATER) Are system resources being effectively utilized?

- No, because the IO process is set to "run later". The next three CPU process happen right after another, and only then another
  two IO processes are initiated, setting the CPU in an idle state.

Output:
```sh
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1        PID: 2        PID: 3           CPU           IOs

----------------------------

7. Now run the same processes, but with -I IO RUN IMMEDIATE set, which immediately runs the process 
   that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed 
   an I/O again be a good idea?

- The CPU-bound processes are not running back to back anymore, instead the IO processes are initiated right after the CPU processes are done.
  This is a more efficient use of resources because the usage of both CPU and IO are maximized, solving the issue of Question 6.

Output:
```sh

-S SWITCH ON IO vs -S SWITCH ON END

- SWITCH ON IO gives the same result. SWITCH ON END is way worse.

-S SWITCH ON IO vs SWITCH ON END

- SWITCH ON IO gives the same result SWITCH ON END is way worse.

There are a few other important flags:
```sh
  -s SEED, --seed=SEED  the random seed  
    this gives you way to create a bunch of different jobs randomly

  -L IO_LENGTH, --iolength=IO_LENGTH
    this determines how long IOs take to complete (default is 5 ticks)

  -S PROCESS_SWITCH_BEHAVIOR, --switch=PROCESS_SWITCH_BEHAVIOR
                        when to switch between processes: SWITCH_ON_IO, SWITCH_ON_END
    this determines when we switch to another process:
    - SWITCH_ON_IO, the system will switch when a process issues an IO
    - SWITCH_ON_END, the system will only switch when the current process is done 

  -I IO_DONE_BEHAVIOR, --iodone=IO_DONE_BEHAVIOR
                        type of behavior when IO ends: IO_RUN_LATER, IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE
    this determines when a process runs after it issues an IO:
    - IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE: switch to this process right now
    - IO_RUN_LATER: switch to this process when it is natural to 
      (e.g., depending on process-switching behavior)
```
